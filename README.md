# DSP - Project 0
The project is divided into 4 subprojects. All the code for the project is present in the file `project0.ipynb`.
This implementation uses `Dask Tasks` for performing word count on the files present in the input directory.

## Input
The input files for the project are expected to be in the directory `handout/data/`

## Output
The output of the project will be generated in the `output/` directory. JSON files for each of the four subproject are generated separately.

## How to run
Open the `project0.ipynb` using Jupyter and execute each cell of the notebook sequentially.
